Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table.
If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

// Approach -1 // Using ifnull
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
       LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL)
AS SecondHighestSalary;

// Approach -2 Using subqueries
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee);
