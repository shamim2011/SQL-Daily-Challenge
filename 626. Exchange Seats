Table: Seat

| Column Name | Type    |

| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

    case
        // Odd rows
        when
            id=(select max(id) from seat) and mod(id,2)=1
            then id
        // Even rows
        when 
            mod(id,2)=1
            then id+1
        else
            id-1
    end as id,student
