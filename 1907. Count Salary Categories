Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
(select 
"Low Salary" as category,
(select count(*)  from Accounts where income < 20000) as accounts_count)
union all
(select 
"Average Salary" as category,
(select count(*) from Accounts where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000) as accounts_count)
union all 
(select 
"High Salary" as category,
(select count(*) from Accounts where income > 50000) as accounts_count)
