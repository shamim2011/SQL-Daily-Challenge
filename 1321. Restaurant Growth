In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).
Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select visited_on,
    (
        select sum(amount)
        from customer
        where visited_on between date_sub(c.visited_on,interval 6 day)
        and c.visited_on
    ) as amount,
    (
        select round(sum(amount)/7,2)
        from customer
        where visited_on between date_sub(c.visited_on,interval 6 day)
        and c.visited_on
    ) as average_amount
from customer c
where visited_on>=(
        select date_add(min(visited_on),interval 6 day)
        from customer
    )
group by Visited_on
order by visited_on;
